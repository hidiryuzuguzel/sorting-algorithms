# sorting-algorithms
A program that compares sorting algorithm performance. It reads the input array with its size and choice of the algorithm (selectionsort or bucketsort) from the user.

##  Sorting algorithms performance comparison:

|array size   | selectionSort  | bucketSort  | 
|---|---|---|
| 100  |  ~0    |  ~0  | 
| 1000  |   ~0   |~0   | 
| 10000  |  0.4 s     |  ~0  | 
| 25000  |  1.71 s    |  ~0  | 
| 50000  |  6.53 s    |  ~0  |
| 100000 |  24.75 s   |  ~0  |
